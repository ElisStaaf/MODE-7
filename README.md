# MODE-7

This is a simple MODE-7 implemenation written in our lord and saviour's programming
language: *C++*. No, in reality, I wanted to write it in C, but felt like I hadn't
done any C++ lately, so that's the backstory. It uses SFML, so install that.

## Backstory

MODE-7 was one of Nintendo's prominent selling points for the Super NES
platform in publications such as Nintendo Power and Super NES Player's
Guide. Similar faux 3D techniques have been presented on a few 2D systems
other than the Super NES, in select peripherals and games.

## Install

git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/MODE-7
